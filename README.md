## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me 
🚀 I'm a self taught developer who started my coding journey around a year ago
🪐 Since then I've created a React Native Astrology Social Media app which is pending approval in the app store 
🕸 I've also created two react websites - <a href="">my porfolio</a> and <a href="">apstro.co.uk</a>
🙇🏻‍♀️ I'm currently learning backend technologies like Python, MongoDB and SQL as I want to become a fullstack developer 
🤍 React Native is my favorite language (so far!) 
✉️ You can reach me on shauna.penistone@hotmail.com regarding job opportunities 
🐶 I spend my free time going on walks with my Yorkshire Terrier
