## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me 
🚀 I'm a self taught developer who started my coding journey around a year ago
<br>
🪐 Since then I've created a React Native Astrology Social Media app which is pending approval in the app store 
<br>
🕸 I've also created two react websites - <a href="https://shauna-portfolio.herokuapp.com">my porfolio</a> and <a href="http://apstro.co.uk/">apstro.co.uk</a>
<br>
🙇🏻‍♀️ I'm currently learning backend technologies like Python, MongoDB and SQL as I want to become a fullstack developer 
<br>
🤍 React Native is my favorite language (so far!) 
<br>

🐶 I spend my free time going on walks with my Yorkshire Terrier
